# ARV - Know Exactly When to Pick Up Your Loved Ones

## Description

Have you ever struggled to figure out when to leave your house to pick up someone from the airport? We certainly have, and that is why we created ARV, a web application that tells you the exact right time to get in your car. ARV takes into account current flight data and traffic conditions and determines when to show up, which terminal to go to, and how long it will take to get there. Simply type in your address and the flight number you are tracking, and the rest is done for you!
